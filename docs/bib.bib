abstract = {Summary Infrared (IR) thermal imaging, also often called thermography for short, is a very rapidly evolving field in science as well as industry owing to the enormous progress made in the last three decades in micro-system technologies of IR detector design, electronics, and computer science. This chapter focuses on IR radiation, radiometry, blackbody radiation, emissivity and optical material properties in IR. Furthermore it gives a comprehensive review of the history of IR science, technology and applications.}

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

abstract = {Infrared (IR) imagery is used in agriculture for irrigation monitoring and early detection of disease in plants. The common IR cameras in this field typically have low resolution. This work offers a method to obtain the super-resolution of IR images from low-power devices to enhance plant traits. The method is based on deep learning (DL). Most calculations are done in the low-resolution domain. The results of each layer are aggregated together to allow a better flow of information through the network. This work shows that good results can be achieved using depthwise separable convolution with roughly 300K multiply-accumulate computations (MACs), while state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based super-resolution algorithms are performed with around 1500K MACs. MTF analysis of the proposed method shows a real \&\#x00D7;4 improvement in the spatial resolution of the system, out-preforming the diffraction limit. The method is demonstrated on real agricultural images.},
